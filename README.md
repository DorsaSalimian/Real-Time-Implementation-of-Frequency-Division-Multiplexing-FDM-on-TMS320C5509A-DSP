# Real-Time-Implementation-of-Frequency-Division-Multiplexing-FDM-on-TMS320C5509A-DSP
A fixed‑point, real‑time implementation of an FDM communication system on the TMS320C5509A DSP, including modulation, coherent demodulation, and FIR filtering.
(This project was done in Code Composer Studio software and is a practical project that was done on the TMS320C5509A DSP board)
